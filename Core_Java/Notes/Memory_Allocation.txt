How Memory is allocated in java?
consider a example-:
class A{

	int a;
	public int abc(int b){
	sout(b);
	return b;
	}
	};

public class FileName{
	psvm(String args[]){
		int c=10;
		A obj=new A();
		int g=obj.abc(c);
	}
}


1. In java a stack is created for each methods.
2. If a method is declared inside a class in java it will consume the stack memory but it will declared in heap where that
class is defined.
3. The class is defined and instantioned in heap memory and its address is stored in stack where the object is created.
