Two Possible ways-:
i. Implicit type Conversion
ii. Explicit type Conversion

1.When we try to assign a shorter sized data type to a larger one it is possible but vice versa is not true.
example-:
a byte type variable can be assigned to int type.
as byte range from -128 to 127
int range is -2^31 to 2^31.


2. We can explicitly assign an int type to a byte but we might loose data.
if the int vale is greater than 256 then for conversion compiler would take % with 256
example-:
int a=257
byte b=(byte) a;
sout(b)//1-: 257%256

3. Type Promotions-:
	when we are performing operations and value just go beyond byte size then java automatically assigns higher type.
	example-:
	byte a=10;
	byte b=30;
	int c=a*b//300
