Normally a variable declared inside a class is an Instance Variable for which value will be different for each object.
But what if we want that a variable whose value will be same across all the objects of that class. 
static variables are variables which is common to every object of that class.
these varibles are called using their class name not the object as it is a class property not object.

There is a different area in jvm where all the static variables are stored.	

Static methods works same as static variables except for that only static variables can be used inside static methods.
if we pass object reference in Static method then we can use variables.
if a non static variables are used they must be initialized.


Static Block-: is a block for which code iside it is called only once and even before constructor.
logic-:
Whenever we create an object there are two things that happen, one is the class loads in the class loader in jvm and 
another is the objects are instantiated.
Now class loading happens only once so staic block is called only once no matter how many objects are created.

But class loader only loads a class if an object is created for it.

what if we want to load the class without creating object for it.
Class.forName("className");

static block is used to initialize the static variables.


Anonymous Object-:
Objects which are just created to call the function or constructor.
It can not be reused again.
